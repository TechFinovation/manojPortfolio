# Clone and Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/manoj1919/masterPortfolio.git
    ```
    This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
    ```node
    npm install
    ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository on github. That's it. It's Done.
- You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.
